      content="From architecture to software engineering, I like creating things people can use. My leap into software development was driven by a desire to build beyond the physical realm. From bricks and mortar to lines of code, I find immense satisfaction in transforming concepts into digital reality. As a front-end developer, I draw on my architectural expertise to shape accessible user-centered applications that seamlessly combine style and function."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
