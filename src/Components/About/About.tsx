      <p>From architecture to software engineering, I like creating things people can use. My leap into software engineering was driven by a desire to build beyond the physical realm. From bricks and mortar to lines of code, I find immense joy in transforming concepts into digital reality. As a front-end developer, I draw on my architectural expertise to shape accessible user-centered applications that seamlessly combine style and function.</p>
